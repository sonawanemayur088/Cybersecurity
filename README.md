# 📊 Cybersecurity Traffic & Attack Overview Dashboard  

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze **cybersecurity traffic patterns, incident trends, and attack severity levels**. This project provides valuable insights into network threats, protocol usage, and SOC (Security Operations Center) performance through **DAX-driven KPIs and visual storytelling**.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Single-page Layout** with multiple interactive visuals.  
- **Interactive Slicers**: Protocol, Network Segment, Action Taken, Severity Level, Date Range.  
- **Dynamic KPIs**: Blocked Percent, Total Attacks, Avg Anomaly Score.  
- **Advanced Visuals**: Line Charts, Stacked Bars, Donut Charts, Column Charts, Card Visuals.  
- **Custom Dark Theme** for improved readability and professional security dashboard look.

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **33.82%** of attacks were successfully blocked.  
- **40K total attacks** analyzed from 2020–2023.  
- **Avg Anomaly Score: 50.11**, showing abnormal traffic patterns.  
- **Attack Severity**: Nearly equal split between High, Medium, and Low.  
- **Protocol Usage Trend**: Traffic peaked in 2022 before a decline in 2023.  
- **Incident Trends**: DDoS, Intrusion, and Malware patterns tracked year over year.  
- **Action Taken**: Security responses included Blocking, Logging, and Ignoring attacks by severity.

## 🗂️ Dataset  
Contains simulated cybersecurity data including:  
- Traffic type & protocols (DNS, FTP, HTTP, ICMP, UDP, TCP)  
- Attack signatures & severity levels  
- Incident logs (Firewall & Server)  
- Security actions (Blocked, Logged, Ignored)  
- Date & anomaly scoring  

> ⚠️ **Note**: Dataset is for demonstration purposes and does not represent real-world attack logs.
